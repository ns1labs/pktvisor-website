# What is pktvisor?
**pktvisor** (pronounced "packet visor") is an **observability agent** for analyzing high volume, information dense network data streams and extracting actionable insights directly from the edge.

# How is pktvisor different?
It is a resource-efficient agent built from the ground up to be **modular**, **dynamically controlled in real time** and produce **"small data"** metric and log output. 

# Why pktvisor?
Metric output can be visualized and actioned **on-node** as well as **centrally collected** into modern observability stacks.

# How can I centrally control and collect pktvisor metrics?
Although pktvisor can be used stand-alone, it is designed to be run at scale as part of the <a href="https://getorb.io"><img src="img/ORB-logo-black@3x.png" alt="pktvisor" width="100"/></a>

**pktvisor** was born at [NS1 Labs](https://ns1.com/labs), where we're
committed to making [open source, dynamic edge observability a reality](https://ns1.com/blog/orb-a-new-paradigm-for-dynamic-edge-observability).
